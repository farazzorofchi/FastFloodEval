        <br> This web-app is intended to help users (Individual home buyers or Insurance Companies) to better understand the risk of flooding of the property of interest.
            Insurance companies can use this tool to accept/mitigate/ or avoid a risk. Home buyers can also decide whether to invest on a property or not.


        Recently, federal emergency management agency (FEMA) published its flood claim experience data. The dataset represents more than
        two million claim transactions from 1970 to 2019. FEMA flood claims data was preprocessed and used as the underlying data. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such as XGBRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, MLP, Ridge, and Random Forest Regressor were applied to find the best model that can predict the building loss ratio (amount of claim / insured value).

        in order to provide a sound approach to quantify the loss ratio (loss / insured value) of buildings with different attributes
        using historical claim data.

    <p align="justify">
        The best results was achieved with the gradient boosting regressor with R2 score of 67% on the test data.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        First user needs to create an account. Then the input information of the building is required. Once input information is entered, you will get to a page where you can see the map of property along with the predicted loss ratio and a box plot showing the historical claim information of the entered ZIP Code (if there be any.)

    <p align="justify">
        <br> By utilizing this web-app, flood insurance companies and people who are interested in buying a property can better evaluate the risk of
        flooding for the structure. Insurance companies can leverage this tool to evaluate and decide if they want to:
        <br>
        <br>    1- Accept the risk.
        <br>    2- Mitigate the risk by increasing the premiums.
        <br>    3- Avoid writing the risk.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"
        <br> Homeowners/homebuyers can also leverage this tool to decide whether they need to purchase flood insurance.
        <br>

    <br> There are many other attributes that can cause flooding. This tool only uses the historical claims data and doesn't guarantee
        the results to be accurate. We do not take any responsibility regarding the outputs of this tool and how it will be used.
